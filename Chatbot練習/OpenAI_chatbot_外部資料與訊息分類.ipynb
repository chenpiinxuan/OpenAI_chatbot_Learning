found to solve both', 'of those problems is\\nby using packing cubes.', 'I absolutely love these things.', 'Everything is organized and contained.', \"Things aren't getting mixed\\ntogether or coming out the side\", \"of the suitcase when\\nI'm trying to close it.\", 'For a short trip like this,', 'I will use one of these in\\nplace of my regular dopp kit', 'just to save some space,', 'but my

book', 'is not only is it heavy,', 'but it takes up a lot of space.', \"That's why one of my\\nbasic travel essentials\", \"is a subscription to Audible,\\ntoday's video sponsor.\", 'In addition to

\"you know it doesn't really work that well.\", \"So that's why I always\\nmake room to pack my own.\", 'Another clothing maintenance tool', 'that I always travel\\nwith is a clothing brush.', 'Helps me keep everything\\nlint and pet hair free', 'as well as looking clean and new.', 'And finally, we have a watch roll.', 'You guys know me.', 'I like to have options for the wrist', \"and for the variety of\\nthings we're gonna be doing\", 'from casual to formal,', \"I'm definitely gonna need\\nmore than just one watch.\", 'Alright, so those are the basics.', \"Now I'm gonna quickly run\\ndown my entire packing list\", 'to include all the clothing, shoes,', \"and accessories I'll be bringing with me.\", \"I'm only gonna bring one coat with me\", 'so it needs to be warm,\\nit needs to be

socks,\\none pair of blue socks.', 'And for watches,', \"we're going with watch\\nnumber one on a mesh strap,\", 'watch number two on a brown leather strap,', 'and a watch number three.', 'So that kind of seems like a lot,', 'but it really is the minimum that I need', \"for the range of things\\nthat we'll be doing.\", \"And it also ensures that I'm not gonna be\", 'wearing the same outfit more than once.', \"I'll show you how I'm gonna\\npack everything in just a bit.\", 'Trust me, it is going to fit.', 'But before I do that,', 'let me give you a rundown', \"of each individual outfit\\nthat I'm going to be wearing.\", \"So the first look here is the\\noutfit I'll be traveling in\", 'from Baltimore up to New York.', \"We've got the camel\\ncoat, black turtleneck,\", 'paired with some medium\\nblue jeans, big brown scarf,', 'tan knit cap, white\\nsneakers, and the watch.', \"It's casual,\", 'but a nice mix of sporty and\\ntailored with the overcoat', 'and the sneakers.', \"But the most important thing\\nis that it's comfortable,\", \"which is exactly what you\\nwant when you're traveling.\", 'Look number two is for\\nour evening out together', 'after we get in,', \"you can see that I've\\nrepurposed the black turtleneck\", 'that I wore on the way up and paired it', 'with a brown Glen plaid flannel sport coat', 'and some mid gray flannel pants.', 'Anchoring this look are the brown Oxfords.', 'And on my wrist, we\\nhave a beautiful watch.', \"Didn't wanna be too fancy,\", 'but definitely wanted to\\nbe elegant and refined,', 'so a turtleneck with a sport\\ncoat is a great way to do that.', 'And of course camel\\novercoat pairs effortlessly', 'with this look.', 'So for running around\\nthe city the next day', 'doing a little shopping,', \"we're going with a slight variation\", 'of the first travel look.', 'Once again, the camel coat,', \"which I'm pairing\", 'with the cream colored\\ncashmere turtleneck,', 'black jeans, white\\nsneakers, big brown scarf,', 'tan knit hat, and the watch.', 'I feel like this look is very New York.', \"It's cool, it's a little edgy.\", 'It also feels very simple\\nand effortless to me,', 'so really the perfect look for a morning', 'and possibly afternoon\\nrunning around the city.', 'I am a firm believer\\nthat you really make your', 'own occasions to wear the\\nthings that you want to wear.', 'And a fancy dinner with\\nfriends in New York City', 'is the perfect opportunity to put', 'on my gray double breasted\\nchalk striped flannel suit.', \"I'm wearing it with a\\nlight blue button up shirt\", \"which I've paired with a brown\\nsilk pattern tie to tie in,\", 'seriously, no pun intended,', 'with the dark brown Oxford shoes.', 'Dash of elegance in the breast pocket', 'with the silk pocket square', 'and as well as on the wrist.', 'Throw on the camel overcoat,', 'and I am ready to head to the restaurant', 'for a tasty cocktail, delicious dinner,', 'and great company.', 'Look number five needs\\nto pull double duty,', \"because we're having a casual brunch\", 'before we head to the train\\nstation to travel back home.', \"So I'm going with a Navy V-neck layered\", 'over a denim button down', 'and paired with some medium\\nblue jeans, white sneakers,', 'big brown scarf, and\\nthe watch on the wrist.', 'Nothing fancy at all, just\\ncasual and comfortable.', 'Great for an easy brunch and a two', 'and a half hour train ride back home.', \"Alright, so you've seen my essentials,\", 'my entire packing list,', 'what each outfit looks like,', \"now it's time to pack it all up.\", \"Alright, so first thing I'm gonna pack up\", 'are my tailored items\\nbeginning with my pants.', 'Now, the way I fold my\\npants when I pack them', 'is to just fold them in half\\nonce and then one more time,', \"so they're folded into quarters.\", 'Next, the jackets.', 'Now the trick to folding a\\nsport coat or suit jacket', 'so it packs well is to basically turn one', 'of the shoulders inside out.', 'Then you nest the other\\nshoulder inside of that', \"make sure everything's lined up,\", 'and then fold the jacket in half.', 'Now once again, the\\nshoulder goes inside out,', 'other shoulder nested inside that,', \"everything's lined up and folded in half.\", 'These items go into the large packing cube', \"and I'm not gonna compress\\nit just to keep them\", 'as wrinkle free as possible.',

the other sleeve.', 'Then I will fold the\\nshirt over into thirds', 'and into thirds one more time.', \"And that's how I fold the shirt.\", 'So one more time here,', 'button up the front, flip it over,', 'fold each sleeve over,', 'and bring the cuff up to the\\ncollar into thirds lengthwise,', 'and then into thirds one more time.', \"Next, I'm doing the sweaters.\", 'Nothing fancy here,', 'just folding the sleeves under', 'and then folding the\\nsweater in half once more.', 'Then in this cube,', \"I'm also gonna put my jeans\\nand two white T-shirts.\", 'All that goes into the cube, zip it up,', 'and compress to save some space.', 'Socks and underwear into the small cube,', 'zipped up, and compressed.', 'For my tie, I do have a travel\\ncase that I like to use.', \"I'll fold the tie in half twice,\", 'put it into the case,', 'buckle it in, and zip it up.', 'Toiletries next.', 'As I mentioned, using another cube,', 'instead of my regular dopp\\nkit to save space in my bag.', 'Now, the fun part of packing everything', 'into the carry-on.', 'On the left side,', \"that's where the large packing cube\", 'with my tailored items goes,', \"I'm also going to put one shoe on the side\", 'as well as the watch roll.', 'On the right side,', 'first the medium packing cube up there.', \"Then I'm going to lay the\\ntie case to the left of that.\", 'Toiletries next,', 'followed by a second shoe.', 'Clothing brush goes here,', 'travel steamer goes here,', 'and the cube with the socks\\nand underwear goes here.', 'Cinch that down.', 'Throw the power bank in right here', 'and the
