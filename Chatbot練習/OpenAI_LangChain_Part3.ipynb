We want stories!\\nTell us some stories, mother!”\\nManzandaba would think and think.\\nBut she and Zenzele did not know any stories.\\nThey asked their neighbors, but their neighbors did not know any stories.\\nThey listened to the wind.\\nBut the wind did not know any stories.\\nThere were no stories anywhere.\\nCan you imagine a world without stories?\\nThis story we just began is a story from the Zulu people of Southern Africa.\\nIt is a well-known imaginary story.\\nIt tells how all stories began.\\nIn the story, stories were a gift to a mother long ago.\\nStories are important to every culture in the world.\\nThey are a way to entertain us, teach us, preserve our culture, and to help us make good choices.\\nAround the world, people celebrate the telling of stories on\\nWorld Storytelling Day in the month of March.\\nSo today, we will celebrate this day with you!\\nToday’s Spotlight is on stories.\\nFirst, we continue the story of Manzandaba.\\nManzandaba did not know any stories.\\nSo, she kissed her husband and children goodbye and left her home to find some stories.\\nManzandaba decided to ask every animal she met if they knew any stories.\\nShe asked each animal.\\nSome were kind, but some were not kind at all.\\nSome of the animals lied to her and said they had stories they would not share.\\nOther animals tried to help her by giving advice.\\nBut none of the animals had any stories for Manzandaba.\\nFinally, a big sea turtle offered to take Manzandaba to the Spirit People under the sea.\\nShe held onto the turtle’s shell very tightly until she reached the very bottom of the ocean.\\nThe Spirit People agreed to give Manzandaba stories if\\nshe would give them a picture of her home on the dry land.\\nManzandaba gave them the picture.\\nThey gave her a large, beautiful shell.\\nThey told her “Whenever you want a story,\\njust hold this shell to your ear and you will have one!”\\nWhen Manzandaba returned to land, her children asked her:\\n“Sifuna izindaba! We want stories!\\nTell us some stories, mother!”\\nManzandaba sat down on the shore.\\nShe held the shell to her ear, and she began: Kwesuka sukela...\\nAnd this is how stories began.\\nWorld Storytelling day is not just a celebration of good stories.\\nIt is a celebration of the art of storytelling.\\nThroughout history there have been many famous storytellers.\\nWilliam Shakespeare. Rabindranath Tagore. Aesop. Nasreddin Hodja.\\nThese are all famous storytellers from around the world.\\nThey make stories with interesting characters and wonderful events.\\nBut some storytellers use stories to teach good advice or give a moral lesson.\\nEven simple stories can have big lessons.\\nUsually these stories are called fables.\\nThis is the story of the Wise Old Man\\nIn a village, there was a very old man.\\nEvery day, people came to the old man complaining about the same problems.\\nOne day the old man told them a joke.\\nEveryone laughed and laughed.\\nAfter a few minutes, the old man told them the joke again.\\nA few of the people smiled.\\nThe old man told them the joke a third time.\\nThis time, no one laughed at all.\\nThe old man told them: “You cannot laugh at the same joke over and over.\\nSo, why are you always crying about the same problem?”\\nIn this story, the wise old man tries to teach people a lesson.\\nWorrying and complaining cannot solve any problems.\\nIt will only waste your time and energy.\\nOur final story also has a moral meaning behind it.\\nIt comes from Nigeria.\\nThis is the story of The Two-Colored Coat.\\nTwo boys were great friends.\\nThey promised they would remain friends forever.\\nWhen they got older, they built their houses opposite each other.\\nA small path formed a border between their two farms.\\nOne day a trickster came from the village.\\nHe decided to play a trick on the friends.\\nHe clothed himself in a two color coat.\\nOne side of the coat was red.\\nAnd the other side was blue.\\nThe trickster walked along the narrow path between the houses of the friends.\\nThe two men were working opposite each other in their fields.\\nThe trickster made noise as he passed.\\nHe wanted to make sure each man looked up and saw him passing.\\nAt the end of the day, one friend said to the other:\\n“Did you see that man today with his beautiful red coat?”\\n“Do you mean the blue coat?” The other replied.\\n“No. His coat was red.\\nI saw the man clearly as he walked between us!” said the first.\\n“You are wrong!” said the other man.\\n“I saw it too. And it was blue!”\\n“I know what I saw!” said the first man. “The coat was red!”\\n“You do not know anything!” the second man replied angrily.\\n“It was blue!”\\nThe two men argued over and over.\\nThey insulted each other.\\nAnd then, they began beating each other!\\nThe trickster returned.\\nHe watched the two fighting men.\\nHe listened to their shouts.“Our friendship is over!”\\nThe trickster laughed. And he showed them his two-colored coat.\\nThe men were angry! They shouted:\\n“We have lived side by side all our lives - like brothers!\\nNow you have started a war between us!”\\nThe trickster replied,\\n“Do not blame me for the fight.\\nBoth of you are wrong.\\nAnd both of you are right.\\nWhat each one saw was true.\\nYou are fighting because you only looked at my coat from your own side of the path.\\nYou did not think there was another way of looking at the situation.”\\nSimple stories can have deep truths.\\nThey can show us life in a different way.\\nThey can teach us how to live.\\nThey are one of the most ancient traditions surviving today.\\nThink about a story that you have learned from.\\nIs it an old story or a new one? What is your favorite story?\\nDo you enjoy telling stories? Tell us what you think.\\nYou can leave a comment on our website.\\nOr email us at contact@spotlightenglish.com.\\nYou can also find us on Facebook and YouTube.\\nThe writer of this program was Liz Waid.\\nThe producer was Michio Ozaki.\\nThe voices you heard were from the United Kingdom and the United States.\\nAll stories were adapted for this program.\\nYou can listen to this program again, and read it, on the internet at www.spotlightenglish.com.\\nThis program is called “World Stories to Help You Learn”.\\nVisit our website to download our free official App for Android and Apple devices.\\nWe hope you can join us again for the next Spotlight program.
